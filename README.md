SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS

Client Side:
- Add City to Search
- Have search filters (date added, etc)
- Return additional results
- Include User Profile page


UX:
- Check for taken username before the user plugs in password


Performance:
- Refactor components so that only top-level components utilize state. (Ex. all 3 UserSideBar components can be refactored for only 1 top level component to hold state)
- Save query + city to database whenever user searches a city/query combo that has never been searched before


Fun Ideas:
- Historical listings (see all listings in SF in 2000 vs 2016 )
- Heatmaps
